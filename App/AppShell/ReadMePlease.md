This is not a typical README file.

I just wanted to thank you for checking this repo and explain a few things before you continue.

1. I've included many folders being tracked by a .keep file on purpose because I started this repo by cloning a Swift Template I created based on the feedback I've been getting week after week.

2. When creating the project, I had many GIT issues and I'm not sure if they had anything to do with later compilation issues due to some files lacking any Target Membership.  

3. I had issues with location fetching not working until I added "Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description" = "We use your location to drop pins every 20 m for this assignment." inside the Info tab in Target. 

4. I had an issue with .keep files being tracked in a weird way right after cloning my template (I don't remember specifics).  I had to open Target App, go to a tab, filter "keep" in the search bar, and delete all of them from a list.  This fixed the issue, but I did fail to properly log it to prevent it from ever happening again.  


All things considered, would you please help me by:

- evaluating this template's structure and see if meets the iOS team's working expectations/criteria?

- helping me identify the .keep issue I had so I can prevent it from ever happening again?
